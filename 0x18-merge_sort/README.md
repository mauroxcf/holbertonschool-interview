# 0x18. Merge Sort

### function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm

- You must implement the top-down merge sort algorithm
- When you divide an array into two sub-arrays, the size of the left array should always be <= the size of the right array. i.e. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} -> {1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}
- Sort the left array before the right array
